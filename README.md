# CityShapes
this repository contains the sourcecode to CityShapes, playable at https://patrickwinkelholz.com

please keep in mind that CityShapes was created as a personal passion project, which means the code was written for quick iterations and practicality.
Readability, structure and documentation has been neglected at times. The code was made public for reference only (backend code was kept private so building this repository is pointless).
